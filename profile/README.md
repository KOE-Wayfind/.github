## Introduction

The project, titled "**Development of Turn-by-Turn Navigation in Kulliyyah of Engineering Using Natural Landmark Detection**", aims to address the challenges of indoor navigation within the Kulliyyah of Engineering building. Traditional GPS signals are ineffective indoors, and the absence of clear landmarks makes it difficult for users to navigate and orient themselves. To overcome these limitations, the project proposes the integration of Augmented Reality (AR) technology and natural landmark detection techniques.

By leveraging AR technology, users will receive real-time visual cues and information to enhance their navigation experience within the building. The project focuses on developing a turn-by-turn navigation system that utilizes natural landmark detection to identify distinctive features within the environment.

The primary objectives of the project include developing a marker-less localization technique using natural landmarks, building a turn-by-turn navigation system using AR, and providing an accessible solution for efficient indoor navigation within the Kulliyyah of Engineering building.
